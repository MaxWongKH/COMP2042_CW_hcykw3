##Organizing Into Meaningful Packages

Moving the classes into separate packages allows the programmer to be more organized. In my case I placed the classes into new packages 
based on the functions they perform. I have 3 package, and they are higher, main, and parts.

| Packages | Classes |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| highscore | HighScore, Score, ScoreCompare|
| main | DebugConsole, DebugPanel, GameBoard, GameFrame, GraphicsMain, HomeMenu, ImageLoader, Levels, Player, Wall |
| parts | Ball, Brick, Crack, CementBrick, ClayBrick, DiamondBrick, RubberBall, SteelBrick, TitaniumBrick |
